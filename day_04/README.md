# Feature Endineering
The inputs to a machine learning model are often referred to as features. The process of evaluating and selecting inputs for the best performance is called feature engineering. This section will cover a number of commonly used techniques.

### Categorical Features

### Text Features

### Image Features

### Derived Features

### Imputation of Missing Data

### Feature Pipelines
